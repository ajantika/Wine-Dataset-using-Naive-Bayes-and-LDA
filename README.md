 # Wine-Dataset-using-Naive-Bayes-and-LDA
 
 ## Naive Bayes:
 
 ###### Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of 
 #### independence between every pair of features.
 
 
 ## Linear Discriminant Analysis
 #### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is most commonly used as dimensionality reduction technique in the pre-processing step for   #### pattern-classification and machine learning applications. 
 
 
 ## About the Wine Dataset
 
 ###### These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. 
 ##### The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. 
 
 
 ## The attributes are
 
1) Alcohol 
2) Malic acid 
3) Ash
